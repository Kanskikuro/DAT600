## Assignments
 # Assignment 1
   The first assignment of DAT600 implements Insertion, Merge, Heap, and Quick Sort in Python to
record the step count for different array inputs. Insertion sort was also implemented in Go and C to
measure and compare the execution time. Then there are some proofs of Big-Theta, little-o notation,
and the master theorem and recursion tree to find the Big-O of a recurring equation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/DAT600.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the assignment folder you want to work with:
   ```bash
   cd DAT600/Assignment1
   ```
